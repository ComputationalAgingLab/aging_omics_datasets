# aging_omics_datasets
This repo is for accumulating information of different aging related omics datasets appropriate for meta-analysis and aging clocks train. This repo also contains reprogramming related datasets since it is a part of our rejuvenation studies. Since omics datasets are typically huge in size, we store link, ID but not files typically. Most of these datasets are for **mouse** and **human**. 

## Without category
* [ComputAge meta table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_4lqknpwR2K2RVDHsfEFpItcFzlKsR_qfsmGfdT7yo/edit?usp=sharing) - our manually curated table with omics datasets. Includes single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell methylation aging related data as well as single-cell transcriptomics of cell reprogramming (OSKM, OSK, etc.). This table is updated constantly.

* [Multi-omics datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a_MTNCV7G4nr9OPG3voLud9s-RKYciby/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108039439571736576899&rtpof=true&sd=true) - our earliest project which contains a lot of different bulk datasets. Will be merged with ComputAge meta table soon.

## Gene expression data (transcriptomics, RNA-seq, microarray)

* [Bulk reprogramming datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bz7zqhSpj9WNFMuPblx38hWkoA--x5qIR9nZgDXNoHE/edit?usp=sharing) from this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.12.520058v1)

* [Bulk aging repo](https://github.com/maglab/AgeingSignatures2020_supplementary) from this [paper](https://www.aging-us.com/article/202648/text). Datasets are already preprocessed and ready for using.

## DNA Methylation data

## Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq)
